# COLOR = EMOTIONS

A personal project to keep as a reference regarding the main color divisions and the emotional impact it creates in the users mind.

SASS and CSS
I have used SASS and Bourbon (http://bourbon.io/) for this project.
Also have integrated Eric Meyerâ€™s CSS reset rules (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and
Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/).
